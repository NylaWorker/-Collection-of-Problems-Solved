# -Collection-of-Problems-Solved
This is a repo with problems from either class (algorithms), leetcode, and CLRS.

These is not a project. This was my way of practising and understanding algorithms. 
The spect of this problems is broad. I explored specific algorithms and data structures. 

Here I have tries, trees, n_trees, divide and conquer, mergesort, specific string algorithms like min edit. 

This is no new work or a personal project, but it is to display my ability to solve such problems.
